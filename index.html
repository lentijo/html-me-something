<h1>My life in pictures and videos!<h/1>

 

<div id="introduction">

<p> All my life I have been intrigued by airplanes, when I was a little kid my father used to buy me airplane toys mostly over cars, I grew up loving airplanes and everything related to speed and thrills.

I wouldn’t say that I am an adrenaline junkie, I love extreme sports and I like to try new things that can get me as close to flying as possible.

<div id="Bungee Jumping">

<h3>Bungee Jumping</h3>

<p>Many years ago I drove more than 4 hours to jump out of a bridge. The Guavio Dam is located in Bogota, Colombia. Back in the day this was not as popular as it is today. I remember following a caravan of cars through the mountains until we got to the <a href=http://travelswithmitzi.blogspot.com/2015/01/hidden-gems-of-cundinamarca-guavio.html>Miraflores bridge</a> in the middle of nowhere. Some guys from the lead car got out, tied up some bungee rope, asked me how much I weighed and guestimated the amount of rope I would need, I got strapped and was told to count to 3 and just let go, leap of faith 70 meters (210 ft or equivalent to a 17 story building) down to the water, and it was amazing!! I was winched up and jumped a second time.

<div id="Skydiving">

<h3> Skydiving</h3>

<p>Once I had bungee jumped I was looking for something else and I found out about skydiving, I tried it out and it was a great experience, not as thrilling as bungee jumping but a great experience nevertheless. I have jumped 7 times, 6 times in Florida and 1 in Missouri. All my jumps have been in tandem but I have it on my list to jump solo.

<div id="Flying Lesson">

<h3>Flying Lesson</h3>

<p>Several years ago I was given as a gift a first flight lesson. This was an amazing experience since I had done some little flying with friends but nothing as a lesson, this was amazing and it fueled my interest in airplanes even more. My first lesson took off from Homestead, FL and took me over Miami and Miami Beach.

<div id="Scuba Diving">

<h3>Scuba Diving</h3>

<p> I became a certified Open Water scuba diver many years ago, living in Miami how couldn’t you? Throughout the years and dives the most memorable have been the shark dives in Shark Canyon, Jupiter, FL with <a href=”http://scuba-adventures.com/diving-palm-beach/west-palm-beach-shark-dives/>Scuba-Adventures</a>. The first time you see a shark is the moment where you start loving these amazing creatures, 90 ft down they seem more scared of you than you from them, they are shy, a tad inquisitive and majestic, these were <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_reef_shark>Caribbean Reef Sharks</a>.
