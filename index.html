<h3>Bungee Jumping</h3>


<p>Many years ago I drove more than 4 hours to jump out of a bridge. The Guavio Dam is located in Bogota, Colombia. Back in the day this was not as popular as it is today. I remember following a caravan of cars through the mountains until we got to the <a href=http://travelswithmitzi.blogspot.com/2015/01/hidden-gems-of-cundinamarca-guavio.html>Miraflores bridge</a> in the middle of nowhere. When we got there some guys from the lead car got out, tied up some bungee rope, asked me how much I weighed and guestimated the amount of rope I would need, I got strapped and was told to count to 3 and just let go, leap of faith 70 meters (210 ft or equivalent to a 17 story building) down to the water, and it was amazing!! I was winched up and jumped a second time.

<h3> Skydiving</h3>


<p>Once I had bungee jumped I was looking for something else and I found out about skydiving, I tried it out and it was a great experience, not as thrilling as bungee jumping but a great experience nevertheless. I have jumped 7 times, 6 times in Florida and 1 in Missouri. All my jumps have been in tandem but I have it on my list to jump solo.

<h3>Flying Lesson</h3>


<p>Several years ago I was given as a gift a first flight lesson. This was an amazing experience since I had done some little flying with friends but nothing as a lesson, this was amazing and it fueled my interest in airplanes even more. My first lesson took off from Homestead, FL and took me over Miami and Miami Beach.

<h3>Air Combat USA</h3>


<p><a href=https://aircombat.com/>Air Combat USA</a> is a one day program where you are put in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIAI-Marchetti_SF.260">SIAI-Marchetti SF.260</a> with a former military pilot, two planes, each plane has a rookie and an experienced former military pilot (USAF, NAVY) they take you up and learn the basics of the plane and the basics of dog fighting, after that is Dogfighting time and you are flying the plane! This is the most amazing experience I’ve had in my life, this was a gift and is one of the most thoughtful and greatest gift I have ever received. If you are passionate about planes you have to do this!!!

<h3>Scuba Diving</h3>


<p> I became a certified Open Water scuba diver many years ago, living in Miami how couldn’t you? Throughout the years and dives the most memorable have been the shark dives in Shark Canyon, Jupiter, FL with Scuba-Adventures. The first time you see a shark is the moment where you start loving these amazing creatures, 90 ft down they seem more scared of you than you from them, they are shy, a tad inquisitive and majestic, these were <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_reef_shark>Caribbean Reef Sharks</a>.

<h4 class="plastic">Fast Facts About Plastic Pollution&copy; by Laura Parker<h4>

 
<p>
<ul>

<li>The United States recycles just 9 percent of its plastic trash, less than a fifth of all plastics is recycled globally.</li>

<li>Shoppers in the United States use almost one plastic bag per resident per day. Shoppers in Denmark use an average of four plastic bags a year.</li>

<li>40% of plastic produced is packaging, used just once and then discarded</li>
</ul>
</p>

 <h4>Why should you stop using straws!</h4>
 <p>If this video doesn't change your mind about using straws I am not sure what would. If you feel you can't live with straws you can always buy a metal straw or push for the use of paper straws. We only have one earth and it's pretty banged up.
